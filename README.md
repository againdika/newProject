Project name and introduction

Start the README.md with the project name, and an introduction to the project. The project name is the only level one heading in the document. This must be the first line of the document and must be followed by one blank line.

The introduction summarizes the purpose and function of the project, and should be concise (a brief paragraph or two). This introduction may be the same as the first paragraph on the project page.

This section should include a link to the project page and issue queue. If the project is a sandbox, these links should go to the sandbox until promotion.
